#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.


  Software engineering is the systematic approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems.

  Importance:

  Ensures High-Quality Software – Ensures the built softwares are reliable, secure, and efficient.
  Enhances Productivity – Structured development processes improve efficiency and reduce errors.
  Cost-Effective – Reduces development costs by preventing major errors and optimizing resources.
  Drives Innovation – Powers advancements in AI, blockchain, cloud computing, and other emerging technologies.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


  The Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
    The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the software crisis—projects were failing due to poor planning and       
    complexity.
  Structured Programming (1970s)
    Introduced concepts like modularity, control structures, and top-down design, improving code readability and maintainability.
  Agile Methodology (2001)
    The Agile Manifesto introduced an iterative, flexible approach to software development, focusing on customer collaboration, adaptability, and rapid delivery.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

  Planning – Define project goals, its feasibility, budget, and timeline.
  Requirements Analysis – Gather and document user needs and system specifications.
  Design – Create software architecture, UI/UX, and database structures.
  Implementation (Coding) – Developers write and integrate the actual code.
  Testing – Identify and fix bugs.
  Deployment – Release the software to users.
  Maintenance – Provide updates, bug fixes, and improvements post-launch.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

  Both Waterfall and Agile methodologies are software development techniques. 

  Waterfall follows a linear and sequential process, where each phase—such as planning, design, development, testing, and deployment—must be completed before moving to the next. In     
  contrast, Agile takes an iterative and flexible approach, breaking the project into small parts, allowing for continuous feedback and adjustments.

  Waterfall carries a higher risk, as issues are often discovered late in the process, whereas Agile helps identify and address problems early by delivering software in small increments. 

  Waterfall is ideal for projects with well-defined, stable requirements, such as developing medical software that requires strict regulatory compliance and extensive documentation. On   
  the other hand, Agile is better suited for projects with evolving needs, such as building a mobile app for a startup, where user feedback and quick iterations are crucial.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

  A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software solutions based on project requirements. They write, test, and maintain code, ensuring it meets   
  functionality and performance standards.

  A Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer ensures that the software is bug-free, reliable, and meets quality standards before release. They design and execute test cases, identify defects, 
  and   work closely with developers to resolve issues.
  
  A Project Manager oversees the entire software development process, ensuring that the project stays on schedule, within budget, and meets business objectives. They coordinate between   
  stakeholders, set priorities, and manage risks. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

  An IDE is a software application that provides a comprehensive environment for writing, testing, and debugging code. It includes features like code autocompletion, syntax 
  highlighting,   debugging tools, and built-in terminals, making development faster and reducing errors.
  Examples Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and PyCharm. 

  A VCS is essential for managing code changes, especially in collaborative projects. It allows developers to track modifications, revert to previous versions, and work on   
  differentfeatures simultaneously without conflicts.
  Example GIT.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

  Dealing with unclear or changing requirements. Frequent modifications can lead to a lot of rework. To overcome this, engineers should adopt Agile methodologies, maintain constant 
  communication with stakeholders, and use version control systems to track changes efficiently.

  Debugging and fixing complex issues. Bugs can be difficult to trace, especially in large codebases. Using proper debugging tools, writing modular and well-documented code, and 
  implementing automated testing can help identify and resolve issues faster.

  Managing tight deadlines, leading to stress and potential burnout. To handle this, teams should use project management tools like Trello, break tasks into smaller, manageable sprints,   and prioritize work effectively.

  Keeping up with new technologies can be overwhelming, given the rapid evolution of the industry.Software Engineers should engage in continuous learning through online courses and 
  platforms like PLP, open-source contributions, and tech community involvement to stay updated.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

  Unit Testing focuses on testing individual components or functions of the software in isolation. It ensures that each piece of code works as expected. Unit testing helps catch bugs 
  early, making debugging easier and improving code reliability.

  Integration Testing verifies that different modules or services work together correctly. Since individual components might function independently but fail when combined, integration   
  testing ensures seamless interaction between them. Tools like Postman and Selenium help validate integration.

  System Testing evaluates the entire application to check if it meets functional and non-functional requirements. This type of testing simulates real-world use cases and includes 
  performance, security, and usability testing. It ensures that the complete system works as intended before deployment.

  Acceptance Testing determines whether the software meets business and user requirements. This can be User Acceptance Testing (UAT), where real users test the system before launch. 
  Passing acceptance tests confirms that the software is ready for release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

  Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs to effectively communicate with AI models and achieve the desired responses.

  Importance of Prompt Engineering
  
  Enhances AI Performance – Well-crafted prompts improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses, reducing misunderstandings or incorrect outputs.
  Optimizes Efficiency – Clear and specific prompts help AI models generate useful responses faster.
  Expands AI Capabilities – With the right prompting techniques, AI can perform complex tasks such as writing, coding, summarizing, and creative generation more effectively.
  Improves User Experience – Effective prompts lead to better interaction between users and AI, making AI applications more intuitive and useful in real-world scenarios.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Why are online courses good?"

Improved Prompt:
"What are the key benefits of taking online courses from platforms like PLP, especially in terms of flexibility, affordability, and skill development?"

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
Clarity – The improved version clearly specifies that the focus is on online courses from PLP rather than general online learning.
Specificity – It highlights key aspects (flexibility, affordability, and skill development), guiding the AI to provide structured and relevant information.
